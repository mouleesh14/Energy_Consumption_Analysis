# Energy_Consumption_Analysis
# Problem Statment:
Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

# Tools Used:
1. Jupyter
2. Python
3. Excel
4. Power BI

# Workflow 
1. Clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing units, and deriving relevant features ad Segment the data by relevant factors like sector, organization type, and facility size
2. Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and relevant features like building size, operational hours, and weather data. Identify outliers and potential areas for further investigation.
3. Develop compelling and interactive visualizations using Power-BI to effectively communicate key insights from the EDA and Design comparative visualizations to analyze performance trends and benchmark organizations against established metrics.
